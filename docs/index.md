# Welcome to Tootr

**Tootr** is an app for publishing **Toots** in **Streams** to be consumed by
**Hubs** and seen by **people**.

## Getting Started

This is a web app, so you can get started here:

* <https://lmorchard.github.io/tootr/>

## Hacking

This is an **open source** web app, and you're welcome to fork it:
```
git clone https://github.com/lmorchard/tootr.git
cd tootr
npm install
gulp watch

# open http://localhost:3000

# NOTE: This won't quite work, because Amazon login requires this app be
# served up via SSL. I use an stunnel proxy on my laptop.
```
