# Fancifully Anticipated Questions

Here are some answers to questions no one's asked yet:

  * **Toot** is a white-label term for "tweet" - it's not as dry as "[microblog][]
    post" or "status update". 

  * **Toot** = *Tiny Outburst of Text*

    * "*tiny*" means not necessarily 140 characters, but definitely not an
      essay. A toot be a single notion, easily scanned in a visual gulp.

    * "*outburst*" means it's outloud to a bunch of people - it could be a
      public broadcast, could be an aside to a small group

    * "*of text*" suggests words and sentences.
      But, text [can also be defined as more than that][def].  Texts we send
      each other these days are enriched with pictures and videos and emoji.
      So are toots.

  * **Toots** are [social objects][].

  * A **Toot** is expressed as an HTML document fragment using [the h-entry
    microformat][h-entry].
  
  * A **Toot Stream** is a collection of **Toots** expressed as an HTML
    document using [the h-feed microformat][h-feed].

  * A **Toot Hub** consumes many **Toot Streams** and remixes them to produce
    new **Toot Streams**.
