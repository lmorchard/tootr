# How-to: Amazon S3 Bucket

Tootr can publish to a single Amazon S3 bucket. Doing so requires Amazon
credentials with sufficient access to the bucket. You could use your root
credentials, but that's unwise and dangerous. Instead, you should use Amazon
IAM to create a user account with access limited to the specific S3 bucket
intended for use by Tootr.

## Create an S3 bucket

## Set up static web publishing (optional)

## Create an IAM user

## Set up IAM User Policy

## Log into Tootr using the new IAM credentials
